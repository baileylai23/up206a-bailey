    "The CSV for [LAPD's traffic collision data from 2010 to present](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Traffic-Collision-Data-from-2010-to-Present/d5tf-ez2w) has been filtered to only include reported traffic collisions involving bikes. For each entry with a lat,long coordinates of \"0,0\", we have manually gone in to search up lat,long coordinates based on the \"Address\" (first street) and \"Cross Street\" (second intersecting street) provided. For entries that have neither lat,long coordinates nor \"Address\" and \"Cross Street\" . We created a [Google Doc documenting the process of cleaning up each affected entry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iec81ZXlTOaoUa1vZBHPScEr9pMDE6vaom-cJ_Azbgw/edit?usp=sharing).\n",
