Hello! I am a first-year MURP student concentrating in Transportation Policy & Planning. I was born in Hong Kong but grew up in Southern California and then in Colorado. My upbringing in two disparate built environments and its ties to class and race made me interested in pursuing a career understanding and combatting systemic environmental injustices. I went to Pomona College east of Los Angeles for my Bachelor's degree, and my major was in Environmental Analysis. Prior to UCLA I administered a grant program for disadvantaged communities in the Santa Ana River Watershed (covering most of Orange County and the Inland Empire). 

## Course Description
Our understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways. This course prepares you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data‚Äôs journey‚Äîacquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization‚Äîand how it enables and advances your research from a data science perspective.

The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in planning? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced. All lessons will be based on ‚Äúreal‚Äù data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

In addition to the programming lab sessions, you will be given weekly or bi-weekly "thinking cap" assignments, where you will be asked to think critically about contemporary urban issues. Be prepared to address various topics from the perspective of your own lived experiences, how it informs the topic, and what kind of research can advance knowledge in a positive way.

At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

Specifically, students will learn to:

* Demonstrate the value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis
* Critically evaluate data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
* Apply data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy
* Learn to visualize data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
* Learn to produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps

## My Class Objectives
I am coming into this class with mostly a blank slate. I have previously used ArcGIS (mainly ArcGIS Online, but also some ArcMaps) and have no prior experience with Python. However, I do have vague memories of coding from using R for projects in my undergraduate days. My main objective for this class is to reach a proficiency with Python and any other language we learn so I can replicate and apply it to the qualitative information I will run into in my ongoing and future work. I am about to start an internship dealing with public transit and community-informed grants, and using Python to create visually stimulating maps with geospatial data will be a great way to engage neighborhoods I may be working with. In the future, I want to work within or alongside transit agencies to improve public transportation access in a major metropolitan area like LA or NYC, so creating attractive and legible maps will be crucial to communicating geospatial with the public.

With all this said, I am excited to learn Spatial Data Sciences with you all this quarter! üò∏
