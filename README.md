## Profile
**Bailey Lai** 
*he/him*

Hello! I am a first-year MURP student concentrating in Transportation Policy & Planning. I was born in Hong Kong but grew up in Southern California and then in Colorado. My upbringing in two disparate built environments and its ties to class and race made me interested in pursuing a career understanding and combatting systemic environmental injustices. I went to Pomona College east of Los Angeles for my Bachelor's degree, and my major was in Environmental Analysis. Prior to UCLA I administered a grant program for disadvantaged communities in the Santa Ana River Watershed (covering most of Orange County and the Inland Empire).

## Course Description
I believe the goals of this course are to instill the foundations of spatial data science so that we students can apply it to real-life issues and projects in the built environment. By learning Python, we will understand the underlying mechanics of how GIS spatial analysis programs like ArcGIS function. Using Python, we will then address urban issues through the power of spatial data science to highlight planning inequities.

Specifically, students will learn to:

* Demonstrate the value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis
* Critically evaluate data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
* Apply data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy
* Learn to visualize data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
* Learn to produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps

## My Class Objectives
I am coming into this class with mostly a blank slate. I have previously used ArcGIS (mainly ArcGIS Online, but also some ArcMaps) and have no prior experience with Python. However, I do have vague memories of coding from using R for projects in my undergraduate days. My main objective for this class is to reach a proficiency with Python and any other language we learn so I can replicate and apply it to the qualitative information I will run into in my ongoing and future work. I am about to start an internship dealing with public transit and community-informed grants, and using Python to create visually stimulating maps with geospatial data will be a great way to engage neighborhoods I may be working with. In the future, I want to work within or alongside transit agencies to improve public transportation access in a major metropolitan area like LA or NYC, so creating attractive and legible maps will be crucial to communicating geospatial with the public.

With all this said, I am excited to learn Spatial Data Sciences with you all this quarter! ðŸ˜¸

## Project Ideas
A list of potential class projects:
* transit/walking/driving access to opportunities like jobs, groceries, health clinics, parks & recreation, and life amenities in SoCal neighborhoods (e.g. [TransitCenter's Transit Equity Dashboard](https://dashboard.transitcenter.org/))
* hotspots of vehicular collisions with pedestrian and bikes in City of LA from LAPD and LADOT data
* mapping which neighborhoods have received the highest number of new residential construction and whether it correlates with reduction in affordable housing overall, after accounting for new affordable housing units
